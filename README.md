Hello! 
It's my self-introduction for RSSchool.

Today I want to tell somethig about myself.

My name is Evgeniy Karovackiy. I'm 31 years old and I live in Gomel, Belarus.

After graduating the school I entered at Belorussian Statement Agricultural Academy, 
at melioration and water economy faculty, but I left it after first course.

I have been already learning web development for one year by myself, and since March I 
have been a student of RSSchool.

Today, I have strong knowleges of JavaScript basics, HTML and CSS, and some knowleges 
at Node JS and React Framework. Currently I'am learning advantages of JavaScript, 
Object orientationed programming, for example, and more.
After it I am going to learn TypeScript programming. 

I have been started learning programming when I was a teenager. 
Becouse I have loved computers and technologies since my childhood. 
I went to the programming courses, wrote simple games on ActionScript, 
simple applications on VisualBasic and Pascal, but it was just a hobby and
I droped it after graduating the school for some reasons. 

After my moving to Gomel last year, I have realised that my actual job is absolutely 
unsuitable for me, because I have been dreaming about programming most of my life. 
So, I have thought about learning programming.

Despite the fact that I have not enough time for classes becouse of my daily work and 
considering that some people think it's too late to start programming at my age, I guess 
anything can't stop me on my way. And I'm going to become a front-end developer in the 
future. It's my main goal.

The main reason why I have chosen web development is it's important role in IT-sphere,
in my opinion.
I think it's one of most important range in development these days. 
For example, 10 years ago we couldn't imagine full-featured apps are written on JS, 
but today it's not only web-sites, we can run a post clients, office editors and many 
other applications 
with modern User Interfaces just in browser, at any platform, at any device, at any place.
So I think web development is very usefull and thats why I like it.

My last pet-project is a Tic-tac-toe game. It's a simple web-application, so I have no 
any problems in work, but it's very usefull practice for understadnding Document Object 
Model and input events for me. 
I have used CSS grid for making game field and it's a good practice also, I guess.
If you are interested, I left a link to GIT-repository below the video.

Also, I'am learning English,  because I need to improve my language 
knowleges from A2 level to B2 level.

Whats all :) Thanks for watching! :)
